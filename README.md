## Hi there 👋 I'm Thales

I am a second-year undergraduate student studying *physics* and *mathematics*.

My research interests include *theoretical astrophysics* and *cosmology*, with interdisciplinary work in analytic philosophy, particularly *metaphysics*, *philosophy of mind*, and *philosophy of science*.

I work primarily in scientific computing and computational astrophysics, focusing on theoretical modeling, simulations, and data analysis.

I use Python and C++ for numerical and scientific computing, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn. Research is conducted in Jupyter Notebook, with larger simulations and workflows managed using cloud technologies like Kubernetes.
